This project is about recognizing faces using the Raspberrypi interfacting with Raspberry Pi camera module. 

# About the project

In this project we are training the model using HOG feature to simply recognise the faces of the people using the Raspberry Pi board.
This could be used to identify and recognise faces of people. 

# HOW TO RUN!

1)Take a few pictures of your face and store them in the dataset file.
note:- Make sure that you delete the previous exampler image before running the program.
2)Once you upload your pictures , open the python file named "FaceRecogniser.py" and change the name "carolina" to your desired name in the program.
3)Now run the the "Training_Model.py".
4)After the model is trained then run the "FaceRecogniser.py" file in the Raspberry Pi.

# Further Improvements

This can be can used for automatic attendence.
This can also be used to detect the faces of the wanted people.
